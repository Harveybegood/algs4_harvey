    *   A sorting method is stable if it preserves the relative order of equal keys in the array.

    *   selection: always find the smallest item in an array if ascend ordering, so the swap often happens between
    *   two non-adjacent items.
    *   insertion: it is stable, insertion operation happens between two adjacent items.
