*   Spam campaign. To initiate an illegal spam campaign, you have a list of email addresses from various domains (the part
*   of the email address that follows the @ symbol). To better forge the return addresses, you want to send the email from
*   another user at the same domain. For example, you might want to forge an email from wayne@princeton.edu to rs@princeton
*   .edu. How would you process the email list to make this an efficient task?
