*   8 puzzle. The 8 puzzle is a game popularized by S.Loyd in the 1870s. It is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 tiles labeled
*   1 through 8 and a blank square. Your goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in order. You are permitted to slide
*   one of the available tiles horizontally or vertically(but not diagonally)into the blank square. Write a program that solves
*   the puzzle using the A* algorithm. Start by using as priority the sum of the number of moves made to get to this board
*   position plus the number of tiles in the wrong position. (Note that the number of moves you must make from a given board
*   position is at least as big as the number of tiles in the wrong place.) Investigate substituting other functions for the
*   number of tiles in the wrong position, such as the sum of the Manhattan distance from each tile to its correct position,
*   or the sums of the squares of these distances.
