/*
*   Index priority-queue implementation. Implement the basic operations in the index priority-queue API on page 320 by
*   modifying Algorithm 2.6 as follows: Chnage pq[] to hold indices, add an array keys[] to hold the key values, and add
*   an array qp[] that is the inverse of pq[] -- qp[i] gives the position of i in pq[] (the index j such that pq[j] is i)
*   . Then modify the code in Algorithm 2.6 to maintain these data structures. Use the convention that pq[i] = -1 if i is
*   not on the queue, and include a method contains() that test this condition. You need to modify the heloer methods
*   exch() and less() but not sink() or swim().
