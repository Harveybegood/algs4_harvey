<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The purpose in this section is to consider ways in which some efficient methods that we have considered play a critical role in some applications and to how to make use of our sort and priority queue.</p>
<p>A prime reason why sorting is so useful is that it is much easier to search a item in a sorted array than an unsorted array</p>
<p>Even though these mechanisms and implementations we have studied are relatively simple, they are applicable in variety of appliations.</p>
